The method using 2-D discrete wavelet decomposition in [12] focuses on the stroke analysis of charac- ters. Therefore, the existing methods are not efficient for short words in different fonts. The obtained classification accuracy of ResNet-50 is higher than that of Alexnet because there are more layers in the architecture of the network. Comparing to the fine-tuning of CNNs, the combination of CNNs and SVM shows better performance. In this case, fine-tuning the pre-trained CNNs is used for the new task of classification of variable and word. Due to the small number of variable and word images, the use of fine-tuning is not as efficient as the combination of CNNs and SVM. In reality, the feature extraction depends on the clearness of testing datasets. In some circumstances, there are some noises generated from the segmentation of images. It can cause the misclassification (e.g some short words such as \u201din\u201d or \u201dof\u201d can be detected with errors as variables). The variable containing a single character has caused higher error rate in the classification than the variable containing an index. Actually, there are more variances of positions in the layout of the vari- able containing an index than that of the variable containing a single character. The feature allows to discriminate the type of variable from textual word more accurately. C. Time efficiency In order to compare the execution performance of the meth- ods, the execution time of the classification of testing variable and textual word is evaluated. The methods are implemented in Matlab R2018a environment and run on a computer with 6GB RAM and Core i3-2.67 GHz processor. The execution time of the discrimination of variables from words in testing phase is shown in the table III. Actually, CNNs consumes more time than those of traditional approaches in the feature extraction because the CNNs aim to automatically extract more visual features than traditional methods in order to improve the classification accuracy. The ResNet-50 consists of more layers than Alexnet, therefore, it takes more time for the CNN to extract features of images. The mathematical expression detection is a key step of building mathematical retrieval systems. For the systems, the prerequisite step is executed offline. It is not required to perform the step in real time and the accuracy in the detection is important to achieve. V. C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK We have presented the method for detecting variables in inline expressions in document images. In the work, the employment and optimization of CNNs including Alexnet and Resnet-50 allow to obtain the highest precision of 99.5% for the classification of variable and word images. The uses of pre-trained CNNs as feature extractors and the SVM as a classifier out-perform traditional methods in the classification. Besides, pre-trained CNNs allow to extract discriminant fea- tures of image with an appropriate consumption of time and resource. In the future, context information of variable can be investigated and integrated to improve the accuracy for the detection. Moreover, different machine learning algorithms can be used in order to determine the optimized choice for the classification of variable and word.

These 11 elements have atomic numbers less than 21 and, thus, have low atomic masses. Table 2.1 lists the levels of various elements in the human body; their levels in other organisms are similar. Inspection of this table suggests that the distribution of elements in living systems is by no means accidental. The most common elements inside or- ganisms are not the elements that are most abundant in the earth\u2019s crust. For example, silicon, aluminum, and iron con- stitute 39.2% of the earth\u2019s crust, but they exist in trace amounts in the human body. On the other hand, carbon at- oms make up 18.5% of the human body but only 0.03% of the earth\u2019s crust. Ninety-two elements occur naturally on earth; only eleven of them are found in significant amounts in living organisms. Four of them\u2014oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen\u2014constitute 96.3% of the weight of your body. Chapter 2 The Nature of Molecules 25 ","maths":[]}

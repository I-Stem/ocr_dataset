ABSTRACT A detection method for mathematical expressions in scientific document images is proposed. Inspired by the promising performance of U-Net, a convolutional network architecture originally proposed for the semantic segmentation of biomedical images, the proposed method uses image conversion by a U-Net framework. The proposed method does not use any information from mathematical and linguistic grammar so that it can be a supplemental bypass in the conventional mathematical optical character recognition (OCR) process pipeline. The evaluation experiments confirmed that (1) the performance of mathematical symbol and expression detection by the proposed method is superior to that of InftyReader, which is state-of-the- art software for mathematical OCR; (2) the coverage of the training dataset to the variation of document style is important; and (3) retraining with small additional training samples will be effective to improve the performance. An additional contribution is the release of a dataset for benchmarking the OCR for scientific documents. INDEX TERMS Character recognition, neural networks, object detection. I. INTRODUCTION The performance and effectiveness of document retrieval systems heavily depend on both the amount and quality of registered document content. Although born-digital docu- ments have become more common recently, a large number of printed documents remain. To input such printed documents into retrieval systems, optical character recognition (OCR) techniques have been used for digitizing documents for a long time. Continuous research and development over the last five decades have achieved OCR techniques that are sufficiently mature for such a purpose. Although OCR techniques demonstrate good performance for digitizing ordinary text in documents, there is still scope for improvement in the recognition accuracy of mathematical expressions (MEs). MEs are essential information containers, particularly for scientific articles and textbooks. The accurate recognition of MEs is strongly expected because it has a wide variety of applications, for instance, correct retrieval, automatic proofing of MEs, and learning support for blind The associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and approving it for publication was Habib Ullah . or handicapped people. ME recognition has been considered and developed as an independent module outside of ordinary OCR because of the distinctive properties of MEs, where spatial structures and spatial relationships between symbols contain mathematical information. Zanibbi and Blostein [1] stated that there are four key prob- lems in ME recognition: ME detection, symbol extraction and recognition, layout analysis and mathematical content interpretation. These four problems are closely related to each other. In particular, ME detection has a large influence on other tasks. There are two types of MEs: displayed and in- line, as shown in Figure 1. The detection processes for each displayed (offset from text lines) and in-line (embedded in text lines) ME are usually implemented separately. When an in-line ME is not detected, the expression is passed to the recognition module for ordinary characters even though it should be passed the recognition module for mathematical symbols. This scenario commonly occurs, and the undetected ME may cause recognition errors that cannot be easily cor- rected in subsequent postprocessing modules.

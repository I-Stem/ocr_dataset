This condensation reaction is called a dehy- dration synthesis, because the removal of the \u2014OH group and H during the synthesis of a new molecule in effect con- stitutes the removal of a molecule of water (H 2 O). For every subunit that is added to a macromolecule, one water mole- cule is removed. Energy is required to break the chemical bonds when water is extracted from the subunits, so cells must supply energy to assemble macromolecules. These and other biochemical reactions require that the reacting sub- stances be held close together and that the correct chemical bonds be stressed and broken. This process of positioning and stressing, termed catalysis, is carried out in cells by a special class of proteins known as enzymes. Cells disassemble macromolecules into their constituent subunits by performing reactions that are essentially the re- verse of dehydration\u2014a molecule of water is added instead of removed (figure 3.3b). In this process, which is called hydrolysis (Greek hydro, \u201cwater\u201d + lyse, \u201cbreak\u201d), a hydro- gen atom is attached to one subunit and a hydroxyl group to the other, breaking a specific covalent bond in the macromolecule. Hydrolytic reactions release the energy that was stored in the bonds that were broken. FIGURE 3.3 Making and breaking macromolecules. (a) Biological macromolecules are polymers formed by linking subunits together. The covalent bond between the subunits is formed by dehydration synthesis, an energy-requiring process that creates a water molecule for every bond formed. (b) Breaking the bond between subunits requires the returning of a water molecule with a subsequent release of energy, a process called hydrolysis. Polymers are large molecules consisting of long chains of similar subunits joined by dehydration reactions. In a dehydration reaction, a hydroxyl (\u2014OH) group is removed from one subunit and a hydrogen atom (H) is removed from the other. Chapter 3 The Chemical Building Blocks of Life 37 ","maths":[]}

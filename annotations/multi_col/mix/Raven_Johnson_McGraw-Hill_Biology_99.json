Endosymbiosis Symbiosis is a close relationship between organisms of differ- ent species that live together. The theory of endosymbiosis proposes that some of today\u2019s eukaryotic organelles evolved by a symbiosis in which one species of prokaryote was en- gulfed by and lived inside another species of prokaryote that was a precursor to eukaryotes (figure 5.30). According to the endosymbiont theory, the engulfed prokaryotes provided their hosts with certain advantages associated with their spe- cial metabolic abilities. Two key eukaryotic organelles are believed to be the descendants of these endosymbiotic prokaryotes: mitochondria, which are thought to have origi- nated as bacteria capable of carrying out oxidative metabo- lism; and chloroplasts, which apparently arose from photo- synthetic bacteria. The endosymbiont theory is supported by a wealth of evidence. Both mitochondria and chloroplasts are sur- rounded by two membranes; the inner membrane proba- bly evolved from the plasma membrane of the engulfed bacterium, while the outer membrane is probably derived from the plasma membrane or endoplasmic reticulum of the host cell. Mitochondria are about the same size as most bacteria, and the cristae formed by their inner membranes resemble the folded membranes in various groups of bac- teria. Mitochondrial ribosomes are also similar to bacterial ribosomes in size and structure. Both mitochondria and FIGURE 5.30 Endosymbiosis. This figure shows how a double membrane may have been created during the symbiotic origin of mitochondria or chloroplasts. chloroplasts contain circular molecules of DNA similar to those in bacteria. Finally, mitochondria divide by simple fission, splitting in two just as bacterial cells do, and they apparently replicate and partition their DNA in much the same way as bacteria. Table 5.2 compares and reviews the features of three types of cells. Some eukaryotic organelles are thought to have arisen by endosymbiosis.

The experiment results show that the layout and format variation has a great impact on the accuracy of table analysis tasks. In addition, models trained on one specific domain do not perform well on the other. This suggests that there is plenty of room for advancement in mod- eling and learning on the TableBank dataset. 2 Related Work 2.1 Existing Datasets We introduce some existing public available datasets: ICDAR 2013 Table Competition. The ICDAR 2013 Table Competition dataset [G\u00f6bel et al., 2013] contains 128 exam- ples in natively-digital document format, which are from Eu- ropean Union and US Government. UNLV Table Dataset. The UNLV Table Dataset [Shahab et al., 2010] contains 427 examples in scanned image format, which are from a variety of sources including Magazines, News papers, Business Letter, Annual Report etc. Marmot Dataset. The Marmot Dataset 2 contains 2,000 pages in PDF format, where most of the examples are from research papers. DeepFigures Dataset. The DeepFigures Dataset [Siegel et al., 2018] includes documents with tables and figures from arXiv.com and PubMed database. The DeepFigures Dataset focuses on the large scale table/figure detection task while does not contain the table structure recognition dataset. 2.2 Table Detection Table detection aims to locate tables using bounding boxes in a document. The research of table detection dates back to the early 1990s. Itonori proposed a rule-based approach that leverages the textblock arrangement and ruled line position to detect table structures. At the same time, Chandran and Kasturi designed a structural table detection method based on horizontal and vertical lines, as well as the item blocks. 2 http://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/cpdp/data/marmot data.htm Following these works, there is a great deal of research work [Hirayama, 1995; Green and Krishnamoorthy, 1995; Tupaj et al., 1996; Hu et al., 1999; Gatos et al., 2005; Shafait and Smith, 2010] focus on improving rule-based sys- tems. Although these methods perform well on some docu- ments, they require extensive human efforts to figure out bet- ter rules, while sometimes failing to generalize to documents from other sources. Therefore, it is inevitable to leverage sta- tistical approaches in table detection. To address the need of generalization, statistical machine learning approaches have been proposed to alleviate these problems. Kieninger and Dengel were one of the first to ap- ply unsupervised learning method to the table detection task back in 1998. Their recognition process differs significantly from previous approaches as it realizes a bottom-up clustering of given word segments, whereas conventional table structure recognizers all rely on the detection of some separators such as delineation or significant white space to analyze a page from the top-down. In 2002, Cesarini et al. started to use supervised learning method by means of a hierarchical rep- resentation based on the MXY tree. The algorithm can be adapted to recognize tables with different features by maxi- mizing the performance on an appropriate training set. After that, table detection has been cast into a set of different ma- chine learning problems such as sequence labeling [Silva and e., 2009], feature engineering with SVM [Kasar et al., 2013] and also ensemble a set of models [Fan and Kim, 2015] in- cluding Naive Bayes, logistic regression, and SVM. The ap- plication of machine learning methods has significantly im- proved table detection accuracy. Recently, the rapid development of deep learning in com- puter vision has a profound impact on the data-driven image- based approaches for table detection. The advantage of the images-based table detection is two-fold: First, it is robust to document types by making no assumption of whether scanned images of pages or natively-digital document for- mats. Second, it reduces the efforts of hand-crafted feature engineering in conventional machine learning. Hao et al. first used convolutional neural networks in table detection, where ","maths":[]}

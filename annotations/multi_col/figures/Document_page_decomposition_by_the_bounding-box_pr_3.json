Our page decomposition scheme analyzes the spatial configuration of those bounding boxes of connected components to extract textlines, words, and paragraphs. 2.2 Projections of Bounding Boxes Analysis of the spatial configuration of bounding boxes can be done by projecting those bounding boxes onto a straight line. Since paper documents are usu- ally written in the horizontal or vertical direction, pro- jections of bounding boxes onto the vertical and hor- izontal lines are of particular interest. While project- ing bounding boxes onto the horizontal or vertical line, they will accumulate onto that line, which results in the projection profile. A projection profile is a fre- quency distribution of the projected bounding boxes on the projection line. The bounding box projection profiles provide important information about the num- ber of bounding boxes aligned along the projection direction. Figure l(c) and l(d) shows the horizontal and vertical projection profiles of the bounding boxes in Figure l(b). 2.3 Extraction of Textlines In this step, the algorithm first determines the textline direction of the page by analyzing both hor- izontal and vertical projection profiles. Once the textline direction of the page is determined, the algo- rithm partitions the page bounding box into textline bounding boxes. From Figure l(c) and I(d), it is easy to see that textlines are horizontally oriented: On the horizontal projection profile, there are distinct high peaks and deep valleys at somewhat regular intervals, whereas on the vertical projection profile, there is no such dis- tinction. Since the bounding boxes are represented by the coordinates of two opposite end points, textlines are easily extracted and Figure l(f) shows the result. 2.4 Extraction of Words n this step, the algorithm groups the bounding boxes on each textline (produced from the last step) into bounding boxes of words. The algorithm first computes the projection profiles within each of the textline bounding boxes. Figure l(e) shows projection profiles within textlines. Next, the algorithm considers each of the projection profiles as a one-dimensional gray-scale image, and thresholds each of the images with threshold value 1 to produce a binary image. Note that, during the binarization, a symbol (or a broken symbol) with multiple bounding boxes may be merged into one, as well as, those adja- cent symbols within the same textline whose bounding boxes are overlapping with each other. But this will not cause any problem in the result of our word ex- traction process, since our algorithm extracts words by merging bounding boxes based on the lateral prox- imity of neighboring boxes. After such binarization, the algorithm performs a morphological closing operation on each of the bina- rized textline projection profiles with structuring ele- ment of appropriate size. The length of the structur- ing element is determined by analyzing the distribu- tion of the run-lengths of O\u2019s on the binarized textline projection profile. In general, such a run-length dis- tribution is bi-modal. One mode corresponds to the inter-character spacings within words, and the other to the inter-word spacings. A threshold value can be chosen in the valley between the two dominant his- togram modes. The two elegant techniques suggested ","maths":[]}

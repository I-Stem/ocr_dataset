Possible reasoning behind this is that the model retains the benefits of the carefully selected features (as done in CRF-2) and the automated feature engineering (as done in BIMExD), and the combination leads to better performance. The feature based model CRF-2 had a poor recall for the B-Math class, which indicates that the features were not able to detect many actual B-Math instances. Since the precision of O-Math is almost 100%, some of these false negatives for B-Math are actually being detected as I-Math\u2014which may still be Ok as the complete chain of the mathematical expressions will still be detected. Performance for O-Math class is boosted even further, and all examples for this class are successfully detected by the method, resulting in a 100% recall. CRF2 precision is higher than the precision of HIMExD for B-Math class and BIMExD recall is better than recall of HIMExD for I-Math class. However, HIMExD is better than CRF2 and BIMExD models in terms of F-measure for all the classes. Overall, the proposed neural methods (BIMExD and HIMExD) achieve significantly better performances over the baseline approaches taken from literature. ","maths":[]}

We study a nonlinear system made up of an elliptic equa- tion of blended singular/degenerate type and Poisson’s equation with a lowly integrable source. We prove the existence of a weak solution in any space dimension and, chiefly, derive an improved regular- ity estimate using tangential analysis methods. The system illustrates a sophisticated version of the proverbial thermistor problem and our results are new even in simpler modelling scenarios. Keywords: Elliptic singular/degenerate system, existence, improved regularity, thermistor problem. AMS Subject Classifications MSC 2010: 35B65, 35J57, 35J92, 35Q79. Introduction 1. There are many good reasons to investigate the regularity properties of solutions to nonlinear partial differential equations (pdes) and systems. Per- haps the most compelling is the enhancement of more efficient numerical schemes leading to concrete applications of what would otherwise be a purely theoretical endeavour. In recent years, there has been an intense activity around the development of a class of methods and techniques that culminate in the retrieval of improved regularity properties for solutions of a given pde imported from another pde which is somehow close to the original one.

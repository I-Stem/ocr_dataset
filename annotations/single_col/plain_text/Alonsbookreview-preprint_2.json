Most of these books [e. g., 1; 2; 3; 4; 5] 1 emphasize the analysis of \u201comic\u201d experimental data and/or large-scale mathematical modeling so as to describe how biological systems work at the molecular level. While this is doubtlessly a very important problem in biology, the object of this review \u2014 Uri Alon (2007). \u201cAn introduction to systems biology: design principles of biological circuits\u201d London: Chapman & Hall/CRC (ISBN 1584886420, GBP 30.99, 320 pp) \u2014 focuses 1 This is just a list of books I happened to have the occasion to consult recently. It is neither the result of a systematic survey of the literature on systems biology or an implicit endorsement of these books. ","maths":[]}

{"multicolumn": false, "figures": [], "tables": [], "text": "Chapter 1 Meet the GRE The Test Breakdown The sections The GRE consists of two Quantitative Reasoning sections, two Verbal Reasoning sections, and one experimental section, which can be either Verbal or Quantitative. In addition, there are two timed essay-writing assignments in the Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA) section of the GRE. The experimental section won\u2019t count toward your score, but you won\u2019t know which section is the experimental one. You should treat all sections like they\u2019re the real deal. Both the overall GRE Verbal and GRE Quantitative scores can range from 130 to 170. The essays are scored from 0 to 6 in half-point increments. Number of questions and time limit The GRE Quantitative sections contain twenty questions each. You\u2019ll be given thirty-five minutes to complete each section. The Verbal sections also consist of twenty questions each, but you\u2019ll have just thirty minutes to complete those sections. GRE Quantitative overview The two sections in this category are made up of approximately seven quantitative comparison questions and thirteen non\u2013quantitative comparison questions (don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll explain comparison and non-comparison questions soon). Possible question types include the following (these four example practice questions will be explained starting on page 35; no need to worry about solving them now!): 1 ","maths":[]}
